This directory contains local development related content.

* Sub directories
  * `hapi_home` is the HAPI runtime working directory.
  * `intellij_runs` contains IntelliJ run/debug configurations configured for local development along with the HAPI setup.
  * `r4-examples` contains a few R4 JSON files useful for testing.
  * `rest-calls` are IntelliJ REST client files.
  * `schemas` are for FHIR JSON Schema files.
  * `dev.code-workspace` is a VS Code workspace file configured to edit the R4 examples with schema support (since VSC has better JSON Schema support as far as I can tell).
